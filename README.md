Features:

- if a "docs/setup_source.sh" script exists, it will be ran before building the docs.
- The project's conda package will be installed if it's already been uploaded as an artifact.
- Supports both GitHub hosted and self-hosted runners.  

## Getting Started

> All inputs are optional. Just follow the project configuration guidelines below.

### Standard Documentation Configuration

- Place environment yml file for documention in envs/build-docs.yml.
- Put any and all documentation files in the docs/source directory. _except readme file_

### Basic Usage

```yaml
job-name:
  runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # Builds the documentation package using the standard configuration
    - uses: cascode-labs/build-sphinx-action/action.yml@v0
```

## Custom Configuration

### Inputs

- **docs_path**: The path to the recipe from the repo root.  
  Optional, default: 'docs'
- **conda_build_env_filepath**: Yaml Conda build environment definition file
  default: 'action_default' which uses the environment described in a section below.
- **conda_build_env_name**: Name of the Conda build environment
  default: '${{ github.event.repository.name }}-build-docs"'
- **base_env_prefix**:  The prefix of the base Conda environment.  
  THis should be set for self-hosted runners.  GitHub-hosted runners should use the conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
  action to initialize conda.
  Optional, default: '/usr/share/miniconda'
- **artifact_name**:  The display name of the uploaded documentation artifact.  
  Optional, default: 'documentation'
- **package_folder_path**: Path to the folder containing the project's Conda package(s) to be installed in the build
  environment.  This is helpful if you are trying to auto-document those packages.
  default: 'conda_package'
- **package_name**: Name of the project's Conda package.
  default: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}  

### Outputs

- **package-filepath**: The file path of the generated package.  It will return "None" if no package was created.

### Artifacts Uploaded

The following are uploaded to the run as artifacts.

- **documentation**: The html file for the newly created docs.

### Example customized workflow

```yaml
job-name:
  runs-on: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # Initializes Conda on a GitHub hosted Runner
    - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.7
    # Runs the action with the following inputs or defaults if not specified.
    - uses: cascode-labs/build-sphinx-action/action.yml@v0
      with:
        docs_path: '{NEW_DOCS_PATH}'
        conda_build_env_filepath: '{NEW_CONDA_BUILD_ENV_FILEPATH}'
        conda_build_env_name: '{NEW_CONDA_BUILD_ENV_NAME}'
        base_env_prefix: '{NEW_BASE_ENV_PREFIX}'
        artifact_name: '{NEW_ARTIFACT_NAME}'
        package_folder_path: '{NEW_PACKAGE_FOLDER_PATH}'
        package_name: '{NEW_PACKAGE_NAME}'
```
